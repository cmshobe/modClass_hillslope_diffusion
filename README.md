To my friendly reviewer:
-assuming you have Python up and running,
all you need to do is navigate with the terminal
to where this script is on your computer
and type (without the quotes) 'python shobe_2d_hillslope.py'.
-If it doesn't run, it likely means there are Python
version or dependency problems.
